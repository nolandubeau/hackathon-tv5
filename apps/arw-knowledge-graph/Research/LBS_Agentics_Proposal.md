## Alignment with LBS Mission & Strategy

### Strategic Fit

**"Forever Forward" Campaign:**  
The Agentics chapter directly supports LBS's £125M+ fundraising campaign to amplify global impact through research, innovation, and scholarships.

**IEPC Mission:**  
"Create and finance the companies of the future and shape the people who will lead them." Agentics is the ultimate expression of this mission—students literally building the AI companies of tomorrow.

**Data Science & AI Initiative Goals:**  
"Provide evidence-based insights that help businesses, workers and policymakers translate AI's promise into tangible benefits." Agentics translates research into working prototypes that deliver those benefits.

**Entrepreneurial Ecosystem:**  
LBS aims to be recognized as a "venture creation and financing hub." An Agentics chapter creates a visible, scalable model for turning ideas into ventures.

### Values Alignment

**Open Knowledge:**  
All Agentics projects are open-source, embodying academic principles of knowledge sharing.

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Concerns & Responses

**Concern:** "We don't have a computer science department."  
**Response:** That's precisely the opportunity. LBS brings business and strategy expertise that CS departments lack. We'll partner with Imperial College, UCL, and King's for technical depth while LBS provides commercial acumen.

**Concern:** "Will this distract from core academic mission?"  
**Response:** Agentics enhances research impact and creates new publication opportunities. Faculty studying AI adoption can now conduct experiments with real users of real tools. It's research acceleration, not distraction.

**Concern:** "Students might prioritize startups over coursework."  
**Response:** Agentics projects can be integrated into capstone courses, independent studies, and electives. We'll ensure academic credit for participation, not competition with it.

**Concern:** "What if projects fail or produce low-quality tools?"  
**Response:** Failure is part of innovation. Open-source philosophy means the community can improve any tool. We'll focus on learning, not just successful launches.

**Concern:** "Regulatory or ethical risks from AI applications."  
**Response:** LBS's ethics faculty and Wheeler Institute will be embedded in project governance. Every tool will undergo ethical review before public release.
