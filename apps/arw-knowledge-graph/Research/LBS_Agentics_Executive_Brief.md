## The Opportunity

**Transform LBS's world-class research into AI-powered tools and startups**

London Business School is uniquely positioned to lead Europe's agentic AI revolution. With 30%+ of faculty researching AI-organization intersections, newly launched Data Science & AI Initiative, and #7 global MBA ranking, LBS can differentiate itself by making cutting-edge research accessible, actionable, and entrepreneurial.

## What is Agentics?

**Agentic AI** = Autonomous AI systems that can plan, execute, and adapt to achieve goals

- Goes beyond chatbots to AI that can **DO things** (not just answer questions)
- Example: An AI agent that analyzes your competitors, researches market trends, drafts strategy documents, and presents recommendations—all autonomously
- The next frontier after generative AI (ChatGPT, etc.)

✅ **Startup accelerator** to commercialize best projects  
✅ **Alumni upskilling program** in agentic AI  
✅ **Corporate partnership ecosystem** for funding and collaboration  

### Resources Required
