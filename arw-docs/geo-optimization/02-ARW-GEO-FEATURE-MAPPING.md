      reading_level: 9  # Flesch-Kincaid grade
      flesch_score: 65  # Flesch Reading Ease (60-70 = Plain English)
      complexity: "intermediate"
```

#### 4.5.2 Fluency Best Practices

**Preferred Patterns:**
- ✅ Active voice: "We help businesses optimize processes"
- ❌ Passive voice: "Processes are optimized by our solutions"

- ✅ Concise: "Our tool increases productivity by 40%"
- ❌ Verbose: "Through the utilization of our innovative tool, productivity improvements of up to 40% can be achieved"

- ✅ Specific: "Reduce page load time from 3s to 1.2s"
- ❌ Vague: "Significantly improve performance"

**Natural Language Flow:**
- Use transitions between ideas
- Maintain consistent tone
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Structure content logically (problem → solution → benefit)

#### 4.5.3 AI-Preferred Content Structure

**Clarity Patterns:**
1. Lead with key information (inverted pyramid)
2. Use descriptive headers (question-based when appropriate)
3. Break complex topics into digestible sections
4. Provide examples and context
5. Define technical terms on first use

**Example:**
```markdown
## How to Optimize Page Speed

Page speed directly impacts user experience and conversions.

    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3.11.6 Large-Scale Entity Management

For sites with 1,000+ entities, use paginated index:
```yaml
entities:
  index_url: "/.well-known/arw-entity-index.json"
  total_entities: 5000
  total_relationships: 12000
```

Paginated index:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2",
  "page_size": 1000,
  "pages": [
    {"url": "/.well-known/arw-entities-1.json", "entity_count": 1000},
    {"url": "/.well-known/arw-entities-2.json", "entity_count": 1000}
  ]
}
```
```

**Expected Impact:**
- +30-50% entity optimization improvement
